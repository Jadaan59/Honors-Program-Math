# üîê CS Gems Final Project ‚Äì Quadratic Residues, Goldwasser-Micali, and Paillier Encryption Schemes

## üß≠ Pillar of the Project

**Theoretical Depth and Mathematical Foundations of Cryptography**  
This project explores how abstract number-theoretic concepts, particularly quadratic residues, underpin real-world cryptographic systems. The central theme is demonstrating how rigorous mathematical structures such as the Legendre and Jacobi symbols contribute to constructing encryption schemes like **Goldwasser-Micali** and **Paillier**, which achieve **semantic security** and **homomorphic properties**.

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project presents a theoretical and comparative analysis of two probabilistic public-key cryptosystems: the **Goldwasser-Micali (GM)** encryption scheme and the **Paillier** encryption scheme.

We begin by introducing the concept of **quadratic residues**, exploring the mathematical tools needed to classify them, including the **Legendre** and **Jacobi** symbols. These ideas lead to the Goldwasser-Micali encryption system, which achieves semantic security through the **Quadratic Residuosity Assumption**.

We then explore the **Paillier cryptosystem**, another probabilistic scheme that is not only semantically secure under the **Decisional Composite Residuosity Assumption (DCRA)**, but also exhibits an **additive homomorphic property**, allowing certain computations on encrypted data without decryption.

The project concludes with a theoretical comparison between GM and Paillier in terms of security assumptions, efficiency, and applications.
